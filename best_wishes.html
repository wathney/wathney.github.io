<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>I have tried wearing
earplugs, but not being able to hear him is worse. I wouldn't be able
to hear if he found a way in. Sometimes he is silent for hours, and I
lay in bed, or hide in a corner, listening for him. As I am sure he
stands outside, motionless, with his head cocked, listening for me. I
dare not look out the window, for I know that if I do, I'll see his
dead eyes staring back at me. Eyes glowing with a ghostly shine, as
though reflecting the blue-green light from some unseen alien moon.
Last night I briefly nodded off, and dreamt that the forest
surrounding the house was filled with glowing eyes. I awoke with a
start, and covered in a clammy sweat that reeked of fear. The bed
beneath me, along with the clothes I wore, were damp, and brought
back bad memories of wetting the bed. I was a worrisome child,
afflicted with anxieties and nightmares at a young age. Many were
forgotten upon waking, but one in particular was still vivid in my
mind. I was being chased by a pack of slavering wolves, loping behind
me, always gaining, and nipping at my heels as I try to run. I lean
forward at an impossible angle, trying to pump my legs faster, but
the effort is futile. I move in slow-motion, like running underwater.
I wake up just before they catch me.</FONT></FONT></P>

awake from a dream, with memory of the particulars already fading,
leaving only a vague sense of foreboding. Upon awakening, I would
notice a dark figure in my room. Just standing there at the foot of
the bed, or in the corner of the room, on the edge of my peripheral
vision. I would be paralyzed, unable to move, or scream, or flee, and
unable to remove the suffocating weight pressing down on my chest.
That feeling of being half-awake, like a state of drunkenness. Things
don't really make sense, and your thoughts don't connect together the
right way. After some time the figure would fade, and movement would
return to my body. The dreamy drunken feeling would slowly fade as
well, leaving only the foreboding, and a hazy memory. Sometimes,
instead of a shadowy figure, I would see giant hairy spiders crawling
on the walls, or a creature sitting on my chest.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>My nightmares
stopped the summer of my sixth year on this planet. It began when my
family took a trip to visit my father's father, Grandpa Whelan, who
lived on a farm in Elk City, Idaho. Elk City was a small town, with a
population, of roughly 200 people. Technically it was not even a
town, rather an unincorporated community. It sat in the middle of Nez
Perce National Forest, and was surrounded by the largest expanse of
wilderness in the lower 48. The only way in or out of Elk City was on
Idaho State Highway 14. It started just outside Grangeville, and
wound it's way through the forest, following the South Fork
Clearwater River upstream for 50 miles, then dead-ending in Elk City.
Dave and I grew up in Portland, Oregon, and had never visited the
farm before. We had, however, met Grandpa Whelan on several occasions
when he had visited us in Portland, and liked him very much. He was a
cheerful old man, always finding time to entertain us kids. Always
ready with a story, many of which I'm sure were subject to slight
embellishment. He could often be found in an easy chair, watching TV,
or reading a book, while he sipped his beer, and took the occasional
puff of sweet-smelling tobacco from his pipe. Dave and I were excited
about visiting the farm for the first time, we had heard many of
Grandpa Whelan's stories about it. We had also heard the many
misadventures Dad had growing up there.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>Mom wanted to fly,
but Dad wouldn't hear of it. He was not afraid to fly, but thought it
a waste of money to fly to a place close enough to drive. If we
traveled via plane, the flight itself would only take a few hours,
but once you factor in the layover, and the drive into elk city, it
looked more like seven or eight hours. By car, it would take about
nine hours. I don't think it was the extra hour that Mom was worried
about, but being trapped in the car with the rest of us for nine
hours. Getting up early to start the drive was not fun. We were
supposed to leave the house by 6:00 AM, so I had gotten up at 5:00.
Everyone was still tired, and Mom yelling at us to get our rears in
gear did not help any. We had no particular appointment to make, but
apparently leaving so early ensured we would miss the rush hour
traffic across great swaths of undeveloped wilderness. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>I did, however,
enjoy the ride there. Crossing northern Oregon, cutting through the
south-eastern tip of Washington, and then into Idaho, the scenery was
beautiful. I spent most of the trip looking out the window from the
back seat, watching the trees fly, and occasionally spotting a deer
bounding through the underbrush. In Montana I spotted a dead coyote
on the side of the road, hit by a car traveling at high-speed. It was
almost torn in half, with its back section crushed and mangled. Its
eyes bugged out of the skull, looking dull and filmy, and its tongue
lolled out the side of its mouth. The stomach had popped open when it
had been struck, and intestines lay spilled on the pavement. There
was not as much blood as I would have expected. In the movies, when
someone is killed, there's blood everywhere. In comparison, this
almost looked fake.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>We stopped every
couple of hours, for a bathroom break, or to get some food. After
finishing lunch in Grangeville, we set out towards highway 14, and
the 50 mile winding climb up to Elk city. There were fewer signs of
civilization, once we left Grangeville, but we did see the occasional
fisherman casting his line into the river that paralleled the
highway. There were turnouts along the way, where fishermen parked
their cars, or tourists stopped to take pictures. It was at one of
these where we pulled off the highway, and parked next to a truck
with an assortment of fishing gear in the bed. While dad was busy
snapping photos, and mom worked the circulation back into her legs,
Dave and I climbed down the short embankment to the river. This was a
prime opportunity for skipping rocks. We combed the bank, searching
for flat, rounded stones to spin out across the water. Dave pitched
one out and it hopped a good 8 times before sinking under the
surface.</FONT></FONT></P>

rock skipper, his record was 17 skips; I had seen it with my own
eyes. Upstream, I spotted the fisherman to whom the truck belonged,
kneeling by the edge of the water. I picked my way closer, to
investigate, and saw he was cleaning a fish. The fish lay on its
side, on top of a rock. It was flapping its tail back and forth, and
working its jaws, gasping for a gillful of water. The fisherman
gripped the fish with his left hand, the thumb hooked under the gill
to maintain a firm hold on the slimy body. With his right hand he
flipped the blade out of a pocket knife, and pressed the tip into the
top of the fish's skull. As the blade slid inside, the fish stopped
flapping and lay still. He then slit open the belly, and pulled out
the guts. He gripped the lump of organs with his left hand, holding
the length of intestine still connected to the back of the head taut.
Using the knife he sliced it off, and through the lumpy mass back
into the water. I watched the ropey length of entrails twisting
through the water, and they reminded me of the dead coyote. The
fisherman was packing his catch into an ice chest, when he looked up
and spotted me watching him.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>Mom hollered our
names, so Dave and I climbed back up to the car. As we pulled back
onto the road, I looked back, and saw the fisherman casting his line
back into the water. While we were traveling up hill, the highway lay
in a valley, carved by the river it followed. Tree-covered ridges
rose from either side, with rocky outcroppings overhanging the road
at some points. Clouds of fog drifted lazy down the valley, and as we
drove we would hit alternating pockets of obscuring white, and clear
air. This lent the last leg of the drive a dreamy atmosphere, and it
almost felt like drifting in and out of other worlds. We emerged from
the fog into Elk City, and it was smaller than I expected. It was not
even really a town, but a few buildings comprising what I suppose one
would refer to as “downtown”. There were a couple of stores, a
saloon, and a motel, surrounded by a sprawling network of houses and
farms. We drove through town (I almost missed it when I blinked), and
out to Grandpa's Farm. It was a few miles outside town, and by the
time we got there, the handful of businesses were no longer visible.
In fact not much <SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">of
anything was visible, except for the trees surrounding the farm.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

the Varsity team. He was pretty good, and had dreams of a full-ride

great person too, despite the fact that she was a cheerleader. She
was always nice to me. When she came over, she would talk to me like
she actually cared about what I was saying, and not just making
polite conversation. Sometimes she would even play video games with
me. Dave had it all going on. Then the femur</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal">
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">above
his left knee began to ache. Reasoning it was only growing pains, he
thought nothing of it. But the pain didn't go away. After a couple of
weeks, its got worse. I noticed he was starting to limp slightly. His
bedroom shared a wall with mine, and I could hear him at night,
sobbing in pain. Dave finally visited the doctor, who told him that
he had Osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. He underwent a procedure
which the doctor called limb salvage surgery. They removed a section
of his femur containing the cancer and replaced it with a prosthesis.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>Dave survived the
surgery, happy to still have a relatively well functioning leg. The
doctor had said that in some cases they had to amputate the entire
leg. Immediately after the surgery, Dave was walking around on
crutches. He would be able to lose them after he healed completely,
should regain full function of his knee, but would probably never
play football again. It looked like his promising football career
would die in it's crib, before it could even walk. At least he still
had Ashley. That is, until she broke up with him. Some people might
think it heartless, but I didn't really blame her. You see these
people on talk shows all the time, people who cheat when their
significant other is sick. My guess is that they just couldn't deal
with a partner who was sick, and felt trapped, but were too afraid to
break it off. Nobody gets into a relationship expecting to care for,
and support someone with a terminal illness, it's an exhausting
proposition. Maybe they cheat actually hoping their partner will find
out, creating an excuse to break it off. Maybe it's just to ease
their own emotional pain. At least Ashley didn't cheat on Dave. She
just couldn't handle the burden. After that, something broke inside
him. Never again would he be the happy, cheerful Dave I had known. I
heard him in his room, after she told him, screaming and pounding the
walls with his fists for hours. He called her horrible names. Later
when he finally came out, I saw his knuckles were bruised and torn. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>Our family had been
planning another trip to Grandpa Whelan's farm that summer, shortly
after Dave's surgery. However, after Dave's diagnosis, and his
crushing break-up, our parents were not sure it was the best time to
make such a trip. But Dave still wanted to, he enjoyed visiting the
farm, and thought the solitude might give him a chance to get his
head right. So that summer, our family once again traveled to Elk
City. Dave would hobble around the house on what he called his “sick
sticks”, while I spent most of my time outside, exploring. There
were plenty of lizards, frogs, and newts to harass, along with the
occasional deer, or rafter of wild turkeys spotted scurrying through
the trees. I rediscovered the old well on one such outing. It had
become harder to discern amongst the grass and weeds which surrounded
it, as they had almost reached the height of the stone wall
surrounding the well, and obscured it from view. The same thick
wooden cover still lay on top, though now more weathered. </FONT></FONT>

to grant me wishes. I had been worried a lot about my brother, at the
time. Maybe he knee wouldn't heal, maybe he'd get an infection. It
could leave him crippled, hobbling around with only one good leg.
What if the cancer returns? That happens sometimes. A person will
recover, and be healthy for a year or two, then their cancer returns
with a vengeance, and their bones become rotting, black masses. Their
own body turning against them. Maybe I could wish for him to get
better, the well had worked before. But I felt somewhat hesitant to
try, as though testing it too much might break whatever power it
possessed. What if it only has a limited amount of power, and it was
running out? What if it was all just a coincidence, and it never
really granted anything? What if it was just a regular old well, as
Dave had said? I checked my pockets for change and found a few coins.
Of the various denominations I held in my hands, I selected a
quarter. If this wish was going to work, it would take more than a
penny. I sent my quarter spiraling towards it final resting place
below the water, and wish for my brother to get better. </FONT></FONT>

fiddle, the doctors own words. While I was overjoyed by my brothers
recovery, I was at the same time worried by a troubling turn of
events. As my brother's health continued to improve, so did Grandpa
Whelan's health begin to decline. He wasted away to nothing, almost
over night, then one day a blood clot lodged in his brain, and he
stroked out. I felt some concern that I might be at least partially
responsible. Strange thoughts begin to nag me, picking at the back of

was the dead-son-at-the-door I paid for my brothers health?</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

shoulders like a cross, and I dragged his ghost around like a ball
and chain shackled to my leg. Drinking helped a little, drugs helped
more. After some experimenting, I found a combination of the two,
that helped very much. Apparently some people don't like being around
someone who is always whacked out of their mind, because my family
seemed to want to spend less time around me. At 19 my parents
politely asked me to leave their house. I moved in with a friend who

at a gas station in Grangeville, to fill up and use the restroom. The
walls inside the bathroom stalls were covered in graffiti, mostly
illegible gang tags. When I was younger, bathroom graffiti was of a
higher quality. Often you would find a funny message, or dirty
limerick, sometimes a number to call for a good time. Whatever it

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>I dropped my bags at
the foot of the stairway, and headed for the kitchen. I intended to
make myself at home, as Dave had suggested, and if I were at home
right now, I would definitely fix myself a drink. I searched the
kitchen cabinets, and found the liquor in one, on a shelf above the
coffee and tea. Picking out a decent bottle of bourbon, I selected a
tumbler from the cabinet I had seen the glasses in a moment ago, and
filled it with about four fingers worth of honey colored liquid. I
left the bottle out on the counter, in case I decided to come back
for seconds, and wandered into the living room while sipping my
drink. One of the first things I noticed, was that Dave had no
television in his living room. The TV was usually what a person
designed their entire room around. Find the best spot for it, then
you put the couch across the room facing the TV, coffee table in
front of the couch, etc … What did he do with all his time up here?
Maybe he had a TV up in his room. I particularly enjoy television
when isolated, it gives me a feeling of connection with the rest of
the world. Hell, maybe he liked to read. The second thing I noticed,
was the old side-by-side double-barreled shotgun mounted above the
fireplace.</FONT></FONT></P>

the front bay window, and I pondered life's essential questions, but
could no longer see the glowing pair of eyes which had appeared to
greet me. It seemed safe, so I stepped out onto the porch for a
smoke. The tip of my cigarette glowed like a dying sun as I inhaled
deeply of the burning leaf. The first hit always tasted the best. I
felt like an Indian out there under that ocean of sky, with the
tobacco smoke in my lungs, and the earth below me. I felt like I
should be dancing with wolves. But the Indians had gone the way of
the buffalo, and I was only a sad little white boy. It was quiet out
here, except for the occasional cricket chirp. It felt uncomfortable,
like the quiet was somehow menacing. Hungrily gobbling up any noise
which dare disturb its silence, lurking out there in the dark,
waiting to gobble me up without a sound. Turning my head to the side
as I blew a cloud of smoke, I noticed a faint line of pulsing light
out towards the tree-line. I stood sipping my bourbon, and smoking my
cigarette, and thinking for some reason I should know what that was.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>I awoke the next
morning feeling like the desiccated husk of a long-dead bug, laying
with its feet curled, in a forgotten corner. It got worse when I
tried to stand up. I swayed back and forth like a roadside air dancer
flailing his idiot arms in the air; bending forward, near collapse,
before re-inflating, and snapping back up, to advertise great deals
inside. The headache hit the front of my brain with the incandescent
pop of a flash bulb. I gingerly took my first few steps, testing my
balance. It took a moment, but once I had my sea legs, I found that I
could hold myself upright fairly well. Walking across the room
brought the nausea roiling in my stomach, and creeping up my throat.
I began to salivate salty, swallowing to keep my gorge down, and
managed to avoid purging my stomach. Hobbling downstairs I made my
way into the kitchen for some coffee. I wouldn't be able to stomach
any food for at least a few hours. Opening the cabinet, I saw the
half-empty bottle of bourbon I had been working on last night,
returned to its shelf. I could not recall placing the bottle back in
the cabinet. Now that I thought about it, I could not remember
bringing up my luggage either, yet it had been there in my my room,
this morning. But then again, as I cast my mind back, I did not seem
to remember much of anything past a certain point last night. Having
experienced that uncomfortable lack of memory before, I was grateful
for being isolated out here, where I couldn't get into any serious
blackout trouble.</FONT></FONT></P>

saw his truck still parked outside, so I figured he must be around
the farm somewhere. It looked like there was a light on in the barn,
he was probably milking the cows, or whatever it is that farmers do.
I went to pour myself some coffee, and when I pulled the pot out, a
few drops fell onto the hotplate below where they popped and sizzled.
With coffee in hand, I went outside to smoke my first cigarette of
the day. As the caffeine and nicotine flooded my system, the headache
eased a little, and I wandered around to stretch my aching muscles.
When I was younger, hangovers were never this bad. They say after the
age of 25, your body starts dying, and I believe it. Things don't
seem to work quite as well as they once did. Sometimes I wake up in
the morning feeling like an old man, my joints popping and creaking.</FONT></FONT></P>

in my own thoughts, I had wandered towards the old well, and now
stood in front of it. The plants and grass which had once grown
around it were now withered and brown, with the carcasses of dead
insects littering the ground amongst them. There were paw prints
surrounding it, which looked too large to be a dogs. The wooden lid
which covered it was now black and rotten, and on it grew colonies of
strange fungus. With a grunt I lifted the lid and slid it off to one
side, where it finally gave up the ghost, and collapsed into a pile
of decaying matter. A loathsome, feculent odor arose from within the
darkened portal, sending my stomach roiling, and causing me to
grimace as I jerked my head back. Didn't I used to make wishes here?
The memory seemed cloudy, like a dream, or movie, misremembered as
something I had actually experienced. I could feel the edges of it in
my mind, but quickly changed my train of thought, as I knew they were
bad memories. I flicked my cigarette butt inside, as I turned to walk
back towards the house, and heard it squelch out as it hit the water
below. That putrid water must be choked with algae and little
spiraling protozoa. A microcosm of life supported by decay.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

several large expanses of virgin wilderness, with names like
Selway-Bitterroot and Frank Church-River of No Return, it was rugged
country. The Magruder Corridor was named for Lloyd Magruder, who, in
1863, traveled</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal">

batteries, sleeping bag and blankets. I also checked the tire
pressure of my spare tire, the last thing I wanted was to get a flat
40 miles out from civilization, only to discover my spare was flat as
well. Driving a few miles outside of Elk City, I spotted the turnoff
for Forest Service Road 222, and pointed the Subaru towards it. FS
222, also referred to as Red River Road, follows it namesake for 16
miles before reaching FS 468, the Magruder Corridor Road. At this
point there is an old ranger station, but I saw no evidence of life,
and did not stop to check if there indeed was. Red River Road is
paved and in fairly good condition, but once you make the turn onto
Magruder Corridor road, it becomes gravel, and 14 miles after that
degrades to rutted dirt. It is still fairly manageable with 4 wheel
drive and decent vehicle clearance, but I wouldn't want to drive my

spent the day rolling down the trail at a casual pace, stopping
occasionally to admire the scenery. I felt a little more relaxed out
here away from people and civilization, and all the bad craziness. I
could feel some of the tension draining from my body as I drove, and
didn't realize how wound up I had been, until I wound down. The slow
bumping pace of the car lulled me into an almost narcotic state of
relaxation. As the sun approached the horizon, I approached Burnt
Knob Lookout, and</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal">

an old, abandoned ranger station at the summit. Burnt Knob Road
branches off from Magruder Corridor road, and is a steep, winding
climb up to top. I wanted to get up there, to try and catch the
sunset. It's a spectacular view, looking out over valleys of rolling
fog, pierced by the mountain tops. The road, however, was narrow,
pitted, and littered with large rocks. I didn't want to risk driving
the Subaru up there, and so decided to walk it. The distance was less
than two miles, and a little exercise never hurt anyone. I brought my
flashlight, as I would be walking back in the dark. The lookout was
left unlocked for those who wished to bunk there, but I preferred to
sleep in the car. As I hiked the trail, I could spy the three Burnt
Knob Lakes, residing down in the basin. Their waters were
glass-smooth. I could detect no ripple marring the perfect surfaces,
which bent the rays of the setting sun and sent them shooting back
into the sky. The lakes were surrounded by long-dead trees, which
still stood, like sentinels on guard. Burnt Knob had been struck by a
forest fire some years ago, which I assume is how it got it's name.
The dead trees still sway and creek in the wind, their dry, gray
branches rattling together like bones. The wind whipping between them
conjured a phantasmagoric howling, like the voices of long-dead
ghosts. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT>

approached the lookout, swatting at several giant mosquitoes the size
of mosquito hawks, while the sun dipped below distant mountains in a
final flare of brilliance. As the burning orb disappeared, and its
light began to fade, I noticed what looked like a camp fire on a
rocky outcropping, overhanging the nearby canyon. I had not seen any
evidence of other people on my way up here, but I suppose they could
be some backpackers who built a fire to cook their dinner. I
approached cautiously, meaning to get a better look, but not wanting
to reveal myself. I kept myself hidden from their view, for something
did not seem right about the shadows cast by the flickering</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal">
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">flames.
It looked like there were figures dancing around the fire, but their
movement appeared somehow unnatural. As darkness fell, I crept
towards them, stopping just beyond the ring of light from the fire,
and secreted myself behind behind a formation of rocks. Peering over
the rock I hid behind, I could get a better look at the dancing
figures without being seen. From this distance, I was close enough to
see them clearly, yet I could not seem to get a good view. It was as
if I could only see them in my peripheral vision, and even then, they
seemed blurry and out of focus. When I looked directly at them, they
would jitter and bounce around, flickering in and out of existence.
Their movements did not seem to connect together right, as though
they followed some non-chronological order</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal">
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">of
movement. Then I saw, through the licking flames, a man standing on
the other side of the fire, his arms stretched above his head. The
Fire illuminated his face, and I could see that his skin was black.
Not the black of an African, or any human I've ever seen, but as
black as ebony. It was the black of the void. I could hear his song
in my head, wafting past the edges of my unconscious. Then one of the
dancing figures froze and seemed to solidify. It looked like some
sort of giant mis-proportioned man with the head of a buffalo,
massive horns growing up and out from the sides of it's skull. Its
drooling mouth lolled open, then it turned to face me. I swear I had
made no sound, nor made any movement which could have betrayed my
position. I knew there was no way he could see me, with the light of
the fire making a black wall of the night, yet he looked right at me.
My testicles retracted into my body so fast, it felt like I had been
kicked between the legs. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT>

into my system, I turned on my heel and ran. My flashlight clattered
to the ground, but I did not need it, I could see clearly now, in the
darkness. I bounded down the trail like a mountain goat, with long
easy strides. I seemed to hang in the air, as though in a dream.
Going too fast, tempting a bad wipe-out should I lose my footing, but
not caring. Time lost all meaning, and my flight of terror occupied
an eternity, yet only a moment. Maybe I am fleeing still. I made it
back to the Subaru feeling like I would vomit up my lungs. Fumbling
with the keys, I unlocked the back door and leapt inside. I slapped
down the door lock, then folded the seat back down, to open a
passageway into the trunk. Scrambling inside, I pulled the seat up
behind me. I wrapped a blanket around my body, and laid there
shivering, and gasping for breath. I remained as quiet as possible,
to listen for sounds of anything which might have followed me, but
heard only the chirp of crickets. Unmoving, and curled in the fetal
position for I do not know how long, I finally drifted off into a
fitful sleep.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>I was awakened by
the sound of scratching. At first disoriented, I did not know where I
was. When realization dawned, I felt a sick helplessness in the pit
of my stomach. Something was scratching the outside of the car. I
heard it working its way around the perimeter, searching for a way
in. I tried to imagine what kind of claws, or talons, or
inconceivable appendage would make that noise. I heard it working the
door handles, now rattling them with an increasing fervor. I lay in
the darkness with my eyes squeezed shut, praying to any god who would
listen. I felt like I would spend the rest of my life balled up in
that trunk, in the middle of nowhere, but the noise eventually
ceased. I could not fall back asleep, however, and spent the rest of
that night probing the darkness with my ears, searching for the snap
of a twig, or the clatter of a displaced pebble, but found only
silence.</FONT></FONT></P>

morning dawned, I could feel the trunk compartment warm as the sun
shone down on it. Stretching out to flip down the seat back, my stiff
joints cried out in pain, and so did I. Sticking my head out, I did a
quick survey of the surrounding area, and found nothing menacing. I
hobbled out of the car, and after a few minutes of walking around,
the blood flow had returned to all appendages, and I could stand up
relatively straight. The only sounds were birds chirping, and the
crisp morning air felt good in my lungs, which still burned from last
nights run. It was deceptively peaceful, and I almost wanted to write
last night off as a dream, or some crazy hallucination, but I could
not. My brain was struggling to reconcile what had happened with its
concept of reality, and the two were clashing. I wanted to forget,
but as is so often the case, the things you want most to forget, are
the things you most remember.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

shaking. As I exhaled a cloud of smoke, I heard Dave slam the front
door and roar off in his truck. Atta' way bro, run away from your
problems. I can tell you from personal experience, no matter how far
you run, they will find you. I didn't think Dave would be back
anytime soon, so I spent the rest of the day putting to rest the
bottle of bourbon I had christened a couple days prior. Everything
felt better with a little alcohol in my system. I actually started to
believe I had only imagined what had happened last night. Some sort
of crazed fever-dream, caused by too much stress and isolation. Like
being in a sensory deprivation tank, only on a larger scale. That
evening I was in my room finishing off the bottle, tilting it</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal">
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">over
my head to let the last few drops drain into my mouth. I chucked the
empty bottle out my open window and watched it spiral end over end
before thunking into the soft earth below. Picking a half-smoked
cigarette out of the ashtray, I lit it and watched the throbbing
light emanating from the well. It seemed to pulse at regular
intervals, but with an odd timing. It would get dim, and just when
you thought it would go out, flare back to life. By now, I was
getting used to the light, and it no longer alarmed me. What climbed
out of the well, however, did.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>A long, thin arm
rose out of the pulsing glow, with a slow, yet constant speed, and
gripped a stone on the lip of the well. Another rose next to it,
found purchase, and the thing hauled itself out. The torso looked
vaguely humanoid, was thin and emaciated. It was covered with the
mottled white skin of a cave-dweller, and it's rolling eyes glowed
with that now familiar greenish-blue hue. Its arms and legs
mis-proportioned, much too long for the small body. It crawled across
the ground, creeping with jerky movements, like a spider, its
appendages scissoring the air. In the middle of a drag off my refry,
I realized it was moving towards the house. With a cough I spit the
cigarette out the window, slammed down the pane, and thumbed the
latch closed. I knelt on the floor, peeking over the window sill, to
watch it. As It got closer, I could see that at the end of all four
appendages were hand-like claws, possessing long fingers tipped with
chitinous talons. It worked its way across the yard until it was it
was directly below my window, down on the ground where I couldn't see
it from this angle. I heard it scratching at the wall, and I knew it
was climbing up. I dropped back on my ass and crawled into the
corner, where I could not be seen from the window.</FONT></FONT></P>

outside my window. I could not see outside from where I huddled, but
the light of a rising moon cast its silhouette across the floor. I
could hear its teeth chattering like a pair of wind-up chompers. I
could smell it, and it smelled like a thousand rotting corpses. My
stomach spasmed, and feeling my gorge rising, I vomited a burning
mixture of bourbon and stomach acid. My head spun, and my vision
swam, with little bursts of light sparkling in my vision. I curled
into a ball, trying to block it out, and then mercifully lost
consciousness.</FONT></FONT></P>

I awoke, I was lying on the floor next to a drying puddle of my own
sick. I stood on wobbly legs, and leaned against the wall to steady
myself. As my groggy, disjointed memory pieced together the events of
last night, the sickness in my stomach redoubled. How had things
gotten this bad? It seemed like I was slowly, yet inexorably, sliding
farther away from reality; as if my nightmares had returned with a
vengeance, and like a career alcoholic quitting cold turkey, I was
dreaming while awake. And where was Dave? I never heard him come
home. I checked his room, but it was empty. Going downstairs, I
started a pot of coffee brewing, and poured myself a cup. The rich
smell was delicious, and reminded me how coffee, like most things,
never tasted as good as it smelled. It was, however, warm, wet, and
caffeinated, which was good enough for me. I stepped out to the front
porch, and took a sip, it was strong too, just the way I liked it. It
was amazing how a cup of coffee in the morning can make things right.
As I lit my wake-up cigarette, I spotted Dave's truck parked in
front. Walking up to the old ford pickup, I laid my hand on the hood,
and felt it was still warm; he must have gotten home recently. As I
turned back towards the house, I noticed the neck of the empty
bourbon bottle I had thrown out my window last night, protruding from
the grass. I took a couple last puffs off the remaining stub of my
cigarette, and after flicking it into the dirt, ground it out with my
heel. I set my coffee down on the porch, and went to retrieve the
bottle from where it lay, intending to recycle it. You don't get any
money for recycling liquor bottles, but I was a believer in the whole
recycle-reduce-reuse philosophy, and it pissed me off to see
recyclables being thrown away. As I stood, my eyes rose to see the
marks on the wall, leading up to my window. In spots, the dirty
off-white stucco had crumbled away in conical craters. Indentations,
as those made by powerful claws. I started to feel light-headed,
again. Dropping the bottle back into the grass, I fell to one knee,
and massaged my temples with the tips of my fingers. Did last night
really happen? Has all this crazy shit been real? The answer seemed
to be right in front of me, carved into the wall.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

hope that if such was the case, he would have at least mentioned it

hiding out in the barn, milking the cows, or feeding the chickens, or
some such farm-related nonsense. I hardly ever saw him. I hardly ever
saw his precious cows either. Come to think of it, I hadn't seen them
at all. Now, I'm no expert farmer or anything, but don't cows usually
spend the day outside, grazing? And what about those supposed
chickens? I know I'm a heavy sleeper, but I could not recall hearing
one cock-crow since I'd been here. As I came around the corner of the
porch, I saw out in the field, on the other side of the house, that
the barn door stood ajar. I thought of that old riddle, </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">when

The dim gray light from outside illuminated a small area inside, but
the rest of the interior was cloaked in darkness. I stepped in, and
taking my lighter out of my pocket, flicked it on. I heard the
swaying clink of chains. As I took another tentative step, I stumbled
on something, and turning, knelt to inspect what it was. Holding my
lighter down near the ground, and cupping my hand around it, I saw
what appeared to be a human femur protruding from the dirt, wrapped
in a dirty blue and white checkered clock. Startled by this evidence</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal">
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">of
violence, I backed into the wall of the barn, and heard a groan off
to my left. For a second I froze, searching for saliva to swallow
down my dry throat. I raised the lighter in the direction of the
noise, and saw, a shriveled body chained to the wall. There was no
way that thing could still be alive, yet I saw it head loll back and
forth, and heard another moan escape its lips. It was obviously dead,
but not rotting, rather desiccated, like a mummy buried in the desert
sands. It's lips had long dried up, and curled back revealing
gnashing teeth. It's eyelids stuck open, with a permanent look of
surprise, revealed glassy eyes which swiveled in their sockets. Limp

was so angry, I couldn't even articulate my words. I stalked towards
Dave, and as he backed away, he stumbled. Screaming, I swung the axe
in an arc over my head, and buried it in Dave's forehead. A trickle
of blood ran down between his eyes, and around his nose, then he
dropped to his knees. I loosed my grip on the axe handle, startled by
what I had done, and it slipped out of my hands. Dave mumbled
something incoherent, then slumped forward. The axe handle hit the
ground, and propped him up for a second, until he fell over on his
side. His body twitched a couple times, and then he was dead. I stood
there, just looking at him, trying to comprehend the situation, and
not knowing how to act. Then I fell to my knees, and burying my face
in my hands, I wept like a child. My body was racked with heaving
sobs, and my tears wet the ground. After an interminable period of
time, the moans of the creature chained to the wall encroached on my
perception. Coming back to reality, or what currently passed for it,
I stood up, wobbling a little. I had loved Ashley too, and while I
mourned her loss, the thing on the wall now seemed a mockery of her
former life. Bracing my foot against Dave's head, I levered the axe
back and forth a couple times until I was able to extract it from his
skull. Turning around, I looked at the thing that was Ashley, and
another little part of me dying inside, I split her skull in half.
Her last moan wheezed from her lungs, and then she hung still. I
pitched the axe outside, then grabbed some handfuls of straw from a
nearby bale. Piling the straw against the wall, underneath the
leaking creature which hung there, I used my lighter to set it
ablaze. I dragged Dave's body out of the barn as the wall caught
beneath her. As great roiling billows of black smoke rose behind me,
I dug a shallow grave. I had just rolled Dave's body into the hole
with my foot, when the clouds opened above me. Their rains fell in a
torrent, and the dirt turned to mud, which I scooped onto Dave.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>I located the axe,
lying in the wet grass where I had flung it, and walked back to the
house. I didn't mind that the rain soaked me, for it washed off the
blood, and the dirt, as if cleansing me of my sins. I slammed the
door behind me as I stumbled inside the house, leaning my back up
against it. Then, dropping the axe to the floor, I stalked into the
kitchen. I bashed my shin against the leg of a chair, which I then
picked up while cursing, and threw it against the wall, where it
shattered into several pieces. I found a bottle of vodka in the
liquor cabinet, and tossed back my head, taking several long pulls. I
sucked in air and grimaced at the raw alcohol taste that burned in my
throat. I took the bottle up to my room with me, but first I checked
the doors and windows; to make sure that I was locked in, and
everything else was locked out.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>I woke in my bed,
with my clothes on, laying on top of the covers. Turning my head, I
saw the half-empty vodka bottle sitting on the window sill, next to
an ashtray holding a spiraling tower of cigarette butts. Behind them,
out the open window, I could see it had grown dark. Realizing I had
fallen asleep with the window open, I panicked and scrambled out of
bed to close it. How could I have been so careless? There's no
telling what might have crawled inside while I slept. I shut the
window, and saw outside, the familiar glow emanating from the well.
As I watched the light grew more intense, the pulses sustained for a
longer period of time. I knew this dance, I wonder what would crawl
out of that cesspool this time. As the thing pulled itself over the
wall, and flopped onto the ground, I could see it at least had the
regular proportions of a man. It staggered towards the house, and as
it grew closer, I realized it was Dave. He still had the crevice in
his skull, where I had split it slightly off-center, where colonies
of green fungus now bloomed. As he stocked across the yard, I knelt
on the floor watching him. His skin looked cold and slimy, it
reminded me of the fish I had seen so many years ago, being gutted by
the fisherman. I imagined Dave with his intestines hanging out of his
belly.</FONT></FONT></P>

approached a window near where I still heard Dave banging his fists.
Again on my hands and knees, I pulled back a corner of the curtain,
ever so slowly, an almost imperceptible amount. Just enough so that
with the side of my head against the wall, I could see out between
the curtain and the glass. I saw Dave where he had stopped pounding
the wall, and now leaned with his fists against it. His head cocked,
then swiveled around to look towards me, while I fell back on my ass.
I heard him approach the window, and from where I lay on my back,
could see his shadow on the curtain, as he pressed his face against
the glass.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>I scrabbled
backwards across the floor, and down the hallway where I could not be
seen from any of the windows. They were all covered by curtains, but
I wanted to stay as far away from them as possible. I had to do
something about this, I couldn't hide in here forever while my dead
brother waited outside for me. I killed him once before, I don't see
why I couldn't do it again. I could sneak outside with the axe, and
cut his fucking head off. I crept down the hall, hunched over, and
careful to avoid stepping on parts of the floor I knew would creak.
As I passed the living room I peered inside to see if he was outside
the large bay window. The curtains were pulled, but a small crack
hung open between them. My feet padded across the carpet as I moved
through the darkened room towards the curtains. I peered out between
the curtains, but saw no walking corpses, only rows of glowing eyes
which peered out from the woods. Shuddering, I turned away from the
window, and my eyes fell upon the shotgun mounted above the
fireplace. As a sly smile spread across my face, a new plan rapidly
formed in my head. It would be a lot safer than going after Dave with
an axe, that is if I could find some ammo. I hoped it wasn't all in
the barn. If it had been though, I suppose I would have heard it
firing off while the barn burned.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>Being careful to
make as little noise as possible, I lifted up a foot stool and
carried it over to the fireplace, where I used it to reach the
shotgun, and take it down from the wall. Cracking the barrel, I
checked to see if it was loaded, but of course it wasn't. No
responsible gun owner would leave a loaded gun out in the open like
that. I reasoned the most likely place to hide shells would be in the
desk which sat in the corner of his room. It was close should one
need quick access to them, and I don't imagine there were many
children around here, who might find them while snooping around. The
desk was cluttered with stacks of paper, and filled with broken
pencils, cap-less pens and other junk, but after a minute of
searching I found a box of shells in the back of one drawer. I loaded
the shotgun, then snapped the barrel closed, and pocketing the box of
ammo, crept upstairs. In my room, I knelt by the window, and gently
set the shotgun on the floor. I eased open the latch on the window,
and with as light a touch as possible, slid open the pane. Kneeling
down again, I picked the shotgun up off the floor, and cocked both
hammers. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>Taking a deep breath
to ready myself, I then leaned out the window. Holding the shotgun I
quickly scanned the ground and saw Dave pacing back and forth below,
pausing to look in the windows. I trained my sights on him, tracking
him for a second, as he moved to another window. When he paused, I
whistled a high-pitched note between my teeth, and when he looked up,
I emptied both barrels. The loud crack of the shotgun discharging
echoed through the night, and the right side of Dave's face dissolved
into goo. He stood there for a second, with his jaw still hanging
from one side of his face, then slumped to the ground. It was almost
comical, like a sunday morning cartoon. A half-headed zombie with a
cane and top-hat, who sang and danced, but only when no one else was
watching. Hustling downstairs, I peeked out a window, to confirm he
was not moving. Going out the front door, I snatched up the axe, and
jogged around the side of the house on the balls of my feet. The
corpse lay still as I approached, and I saw a viscous black and green
fluid oozing from the wound where half it's face used to be. It
looked pretty dead, but to be sure, using the axe, I hacked off what
remained of it's head.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>I didn't want to
leave the thing lying out there, so I resolved to bury it again.
Grabbing the legs, I dragged the body behind me, and kicking the head
forward every few steps, moved towards the location near the
burnt-down barn where I had previously buried the body. The shovel I
had used still thrust in the dirt where I had left it, Dave's only
grave marker. The dirt covering the grave was undisturbed, apparently
the well had somehow transported Dave's body into it's depths, and
there revived him. The dirt was not as tightly packed as the first
time I had dug the grave, and the soil was still damp, which made the
digging easier. As I approached the depth at which I had buried him
previously, my shovel struck something which did not feel like earth.
I got down on my knees and cleared the dirt around it, where I saw
Dave's rotting face. I screamed like a girl and scrambled out of the
hole with a quickness, where I stood over it, panting from exertion,
and covered with dirt. I looked first at the headless body which lay
in the grass, then shifting my gaze to the body which lay
half-exposed in the hole. A nervous chuckle escaped my lips. I felt
that familiar fear rising inside me, vibrating and bouncing around
incoherently. Somehow, the idea of the well reproducing Dave's body,
was even more terrifying than the notion that it had transported him.
I rolled the headless body into the pit, on top of the other dead
Dave, and kicked the head in after it. I then hastily buried them
together, not wanting to stay out here any longer than necessary. I
couldn't be sure, but it looked like there were more eyes watching me
from the woods, than when I first came outside. Like they were
congregating for something.</FONT></FONT></P>
