After my father died, I found an old overcoat and hat in the back of
his closet. The coat was a faded black, and the hat a worn brown
fedora. Both were covered with dust, and I could not remember my
father ever wearing them. I tried them on, and decided to take them
home with me, as they made me feel like Humphrey Bogart. When I wore
them, the world became black and white, and everything was simpler.
It became easy to tell the good from the bad. One night while
sleeping, I awoke with a start, and saw a dark figure standing in the
corner of my bedroom. My stomach tightened, and my brain dumped
adrenaline into my blood, before I realized it was just the old
overcoat hanging from the coat rack, with the hat resting atop. With
my blood pumping, it was hard to fall back to sleep, and so I lay
there drifting in and out. As I grew close to nodding off, I thought
I discerned a movement through half-lidded eyes, a faint fluttering
of the sleeve. My eyes snapped open, even as my body remained still,
and my vision fixed on the coat.

I laid motionless for many minutes, staring at it, waiting for it to
move, but it simply hung there. As my eyelids once again grew heavy,
and my vision fuzzy, I could see how easily the overcoat and hat
could be mistaken for a figure standing in the corner. When viewed
with unfocused eyes, the sleeves which otherwise hung limply, seemed
to bend in the natural shape of a mans arm. In addition, the hat
appeared to settle at a different angle, as though resting atop
someones head. Come to think of it, had the hat not actually changed
positions slightly? When I hung it on the hook, over the jacket, I
could have sworn the front of the brim hung off to the right. Now,
however, it hung slightly to the left, as though pulled down to hide
a face. But I must be mistaken, I probably hung it that way myself,
for hats do not move of their own accord. Perhaps the rumbling of a
passing truck caused it to shift slightly on its hook … yes that
must be it. But then again I do not recall hearing any trucks driving
by. As I laid unmoving, watching them, I fancied that they hung still
while watching me, waiting for me to close my eyes.

I know not how long I lay there in my bed, paralyzed by a nightmarish
terror, but eventually I drifted off to sleep. I awoke once again,
and due to my grogginess, momentarily forgot about the thing in the
corner of my room. As I swam back to consciousness, my eyes drifted
towards it. Realization dawned, and I was filled with a sickening
panic. The coat seemed to have filled out. The sleeves no longer hung
as limply, and there were bulges in the midsection which hinted at a
mass contained inside. The blackness inside the coat looked darker
than the surrounding night. Then the hat tilted up, and the blackness
stared back at me. With the quiet whoosh of an expelled breath, the
coat and hat lifted off the rack, and the black thing wearing them
drifted towards me. Its arms were outstretched, as though to embrace
me, and darkness poured from the sleeves. The darkness rolled and
sloshed about the room, whipping in frenetic spirals, blotting out
light, until all I could see was the black. It was then I heard the
rustling and felt the thing fall on me, and I was engulfed by the
darkness. Now I huddle in the darkness – in the black – wearing
my coat and hat, and waiting for another to come along … and put me
on.</p>
