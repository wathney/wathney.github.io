<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Richard woke up with a
headache, and a stiff neck. He was also dead. He was lying in a
ditch, by the side of the road, with the right side of his neck eaten
away. He could feel the wound, but it did not register as pain
normally does. He felt little discomfort, but was simply aware that
part of his neck was missing. He turned his head side to side, and
worked his jaw a few times. The cords in his neck could be seen
expanding, and contracting as he moved. At least his mouth worked,
which was good news, because the only sensation causing any real
discomfort was a gnawing hunger in the pit of his belly. As a member
of the living, Richard had possessed all manner of fears, goals,
motivations, and desires. Now, his sole purpose in non-life had been
focused into one incredibly bright pin-prick inside his poorly
functioning brain: Feed.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Richard stood up on wobbly
legs, trying to keep his balance, as his body acclimated to a new
state of existence. A sound in the distance caught his ear, a dull
whine. He wheeled around, and saw down the road, a car approaching.
Richard didn't remember exactly what cars were, but had a vague
impression of their importance, and that, combined with the fact that
it was moving, led him to believe that it might be something good to
eat. He raised his arms in the air, with his fingers stretched
towards the approaching car, and a low, guttural moan escaped his
pale blue lips. It just felt right. As the car grew closer, Richard
lurched towards it. With a roar, it passed, swerving slightly to
avoid hitting him as it did so. The edge of the windshield caught his
right hand, and sent him spinning around, to collapse on the asphalt.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Again he stood, and this time
the pinky and ring finger of his right hand were bent back at an odd
angle, but he did not seem to notice. In the field next to the road,
Richard saw a horse with its head down, cropping the grass. It raised
it's head to look at Richard, still chewing. Richard turned and
stumbled towards the horse. It stopped chewing. Richard reached the
barbed wire fence bordering the field, and flipped, head over heels,
onto the other side. As he picked himself back up, the horse whinnied
nervously. As Richard approached, the horse's eyes rolled wild in
their sockets, and it turned to canter off towards the barn in the
distance. Undaunted, Richard trudged after it. The hunger inside him
was growing stronger, and more insistent, he would not give up a hot
meal that easily. The field through which he walked was filled with
patches of green grass, still wet with morning dew, and soon his
shoes were soaked, yet on he walked. His cold feet, and the wet socks
squishing in his shoes, were ignored by Richard. He was solely
focused on his ever-increasing hunger. He began to chew on his own
lips as he followed the horse across the field. As he approached the
barn, Richard could see two young girls off to his left, playing on
the other side of the fence, in front of a house. Forgetting the
horse, he turned towards the girls, approached the fence, and with a
decided lack of coordination, climbed over. He collapsed on the other
side, and finally caught the attention of the girls, who had been
lost in a fantasy land where dolls have jobs, and clean houses, and
makes dinner, and no one is ever sad, except for maybe the dog,
because he doesn't get any table scraps. Feeding it will not make it
go away, it only encourages them.</font></p>

Richard resembled a man who has just exited a bar after having too
much to drink, and after collapsing outside, is attempting to stand
back up. After Richard hauled himself up, Elizabeth could see his
mouth was bloody, where he had chewed away his own lips. She
screamed, and Richard lunged towards her. Her scream turned into a
gurgle as Richard bit into her windpipe and pulled it out with his
teeth. Her blood ran down his chin, as he chewed with his face held
up in the air. The relief which flowed through his body was unlike
anything he had ever felt as a living person. Sex paled in
comparison. The pleasure he had felt at a party in college, slamming
shots of tequila, and doing lines of blow off a hooker's ass did not
even begin to approach it. The birth of his own daughter was like the
ghost of a long-forgotten memory. Elizabeth's arms and legs flailed
around as Richard held her down, and ate her face. Her sister Annabel
ran towards the house screaming bloody murder, and waving her arms
over her head. Ever the glutton, Richard left Elizabeth's cooling
body in the dirt, and staggered after Annabel.</font></p>

by the time she reached the front door, and as she closed it behind
her, Richard slammed against the outside, throwing the door open, and
sending Annabel sprawling onto her back. Richard stalked towards
Annabel, as she crawled away screaming, ending up under the kitchen
table. Carolyn had heard her daughter screaming, and came running
downstairs, to find her hiding under the table, as Richard threw
chair's out of the way, and tried to grab her. Without a thought for
her own safety, Carolyn launched herself at Richard, climbing onto
his back. She wrapped one arm around his neck, and with her other
hand, pulled his head back in the air. Richard gnashed his teeth, and
spun around in circles, trying to throw Carolyn off. While Richard
was distracted, Annabel crawled out from under the table, ran
upstairs, and locked herself in the bathroom. Meanwhile, Richard
slammed Carolyn's back against the wall, and with a grunt of exhaled
air, her grip loosened. Richard pulled free the arm around his neck,
and sank his teeth into the meat of her bicep. Carolyn fell to the
ground, clutching her arm where Richard had bitten off a chunk. She
tried to cry out, but the wind had been knocked out of her. Richard
chewed on the piece of bicep, and turned to face Carolyn as she sunk
to the floor. She saw his lipless face, the blood that covered his
mouth, and stained the front of his shirt, and she managed a thin
wail as Richard fell upon her.</font></p>

like a basket of chicken wings, devoured her internal organs, then
cracked her skull open and scooped out the brains. This one wouldn't
be coming back. His stomach distended with Carolyn's flesh, Richard's
hunger was satiated for the moment. He rose from the stripped
carcass, and his body swayed side-to-side as he waddled towards the
open front door, and secreted himself away in the corner behind it.
He fell asleep standing there, and while his meal settled, Annabel
was curled up in the bathtub crying. After a couple hours, the
bathroom door opened a crack, and Annabel peeked out. She had heard
her mother screaming earlier, but the house was quiet now. She didn't
see anything down the hall, but then she couldn't see downstairs. She
slowly pushed the door open, and crept out on her tip-toes, looking
back and forth, still seeing nothing. She moved towards the stairs,
and descended, crouching as she did so. From the living room where
she stood, her mother's body was hidden, where it lay in the kitchen.
Scanning the room, she didn't see Richard, and so approached the
kitchen door. Standing in the doorway, she saw what remained of her
mother, and the cry that escaped her lips would have broken the heart
of anyone with an ounce of emotion. From where he nodded behind the
door, Richard heard her cry, and came bursting out. He was on her
before she could react, and as she cried for her mother and her
sister, Richard devoured Annabel's little body.</font></p>

down the long gravel drive which led to his house, he could already
tell something was wrong. On his way home, he had seen three
different car accidents on the side of the road, as well as an
increased police presence in town. He had also heard a strange news
report on the radio, about people acting violent, perhaps as a result
of some new drug. It seemed like every month, there was a new
designer drug hitting the market, many ended up having horrible
side-effects. Whatever happened to the classics? Doug pulled up in
front of his house, and saw his daughter's body lying on the ground,
surrounded by a pool of blood soaking into the dirt. He kicked his

body, he knelt down beside her.</font></p>

“love” and “fair”. He rose, carrying her limp body towards
the house. As he approached, he saw the front door left open,
swinging back and forth in the breeze. He also saw the trail of blood
leading out of the house. Waves of panic washed over him and he
entered, and his worst fears were realized. The bodies of Annabel and
Carolyn were mangled beyond recognition. Their flesh had been
stripped from their skeletons, and the skulls crushed. Richard had
eaten their brains, and dug out their eyes, squishing them between
his molars, where the vitreous humor squirted down his throat like a
fruit snack. Richard had even cracked open some of their bones, in
order to suck out the marrow. Doug's legs were feeling weak, and so
he gently laid Elizabeth's body on the couch and sat down on the
floor. He sat for a moment, looking dazed, then flopped over on his

legs off the couch. Even though it was the body of his daughter, she
looked like a monster. Her throat was torn out, and most of her face
was missing, exposing the skull underneath, in many places. The whole
front of her dress was stained with blood turning a rusty brown
around the edges. While Doug knew that this was impossible, he was
also no dummy, and he had seen zombie movies before. As he watched
the body of his daughter standing up, he remembered being a teenager,
and going to a midnight showing of Night of the Living Dead. After
the movie, he was terrified as he walked to his car, looking over his
shoulder, and checking the back seat before he got in. He stood now,
on legs still wobbling, and backed away. Elizabeth rose from the
couch, her legs uncertain as well, and took a step towards her
father. As Doug continued to back-step, Elizabeth fell towards him.
He reflexively swung his leg up, landing a kick to the stomach, which
sent her sprawling. As Elizabeth struggled to get back up, Doug
turned, and bounded upstairs to his room, and to his closet where he
kept his hunting rifle. It was a .308 he used for hunting Blacktail
Deer. When he came out of his room carrying the rifle, Elizabeth was
climbing the stairs. With tears rolling down his cheeks, he centered
her head in the cross-hairs, whispered, “I love you, honey”, and
fired.</font></p>

time it exited her head, the bullet had peeled back into the shape of
a mushroom cap. It shattered the back of her skull, and took most of
her brains with it, spraying them down the stairs. The jet of brains
and blood shooting out, snapped her head forward. Her face slammed
against the stairs, and then her body slid down, leaving a smeared
trail of blood behind it. Douglas sad down on the floor, at the top
of the stairs, and rested the rifle in his lap. He looked down at
himself, and the blood staining him, from when he had carried
Elizabeth inside. He had just found his family eaten, and then shot
his own daughter in the head, and all he could think about was
washing the blood off his hands.</font></p>

the woods, feeling rather content, given his current state of being.
After eating Carolyn and Annabel, he had decided to go for a walk to
settle his stomach. While the hunger was ever-present, it had
subsided in intensity after a good meal. It was quiet out here,
amongst the trees. The only sound was the creaking of the Coast
Redwoods, as they swayed in the breeze. It was hypnotizing, and
Richard, lulled into a trance, wandered for hours. When he emerged
into a clearing occupied by three campers sitting around a portable
stove, he was stunned and pausing, looked at them, quizzical. The
campers saw him, and the gore which covered his front, and started
screaming. Richard's face twisted in a vicious snarl as he ran at the
campers. One man turned on his heel and sprinted off into the woods,
leaving the others to fend for themselves. A woman stood up, and
stumbling backwards, tripped over the log she had been sitting on,
and fell flat on her back. With the wind knocked out of her she, lay
on the ground, wheezing for breath. Another man stood up, holding his
hands out, as Richard came at him. </font>

fend Richard off, or perhaps it was an attempt to placate him, but
whatever his intention, it was unsuccessful. Richard bit off the
first two joints of the mans index and middle finger, on his left
hand. As the man clutched his bleeding hand to his chest and backed
away, Richard followed, catching the portable stove with his foot.
The pot of water which sat atop, tipped over onto the legs of the
woman laying on the ground. Her legs were clad in nothing but kacki
shorts, and what little breath she had regained was used to scream,
as the scalding water spilled across them. The stove spiraled through
the air, and landed against a tent staked nearby. The Ripstop nylon
of the tent caught, and went up in a blaze, which spread across the
tent dripping molten plastic in its wake. The piercing cries of
another woman echoed from inside the burning tent, and she burst out
wearing nothing but panties and burning plastic which clung to her
skin like napalm. She spun around, slapping at the flames, which only
spread it further across her body. The man missing two fingers fled
into the forest, and Richard followed, leaving the burning woman to
collapse in a smoking, lifeless heap.</font></p>

a split second it felt like a hand clutching him in it's steel grip,
then he was falling. Andy hit the ground face-first, and moments
later Richard caught up. He fell on Andy's back, reaching his hands
around and digging them under the rib cage. Richard pulled Andy's
body up against him as he chewed the meat off his neck. Richard was
still full from his previous meals, and soon after starting on Andy's
shoulders, turned and vomited on the ground. The gelatinous brown
mass of partially-digested human flesh looked like rotten lutefisk.
After purging himself, Richard went back to eating, and soon finished
off the rest of Andy.</font></p>

away, and after he had finished eating, Richard could hear a booming
in the distance. He stood up, and set off in the general direction
the booming emanated from, as he reasoned there might be more to eat.
He trudged on, with his rounded belly protruding in front of him. As
he walked, the boom grew louder, and he could hear the barking of
animals underneath. Not as tasty as humans, but food nonetheless. By
now, Richard had gotten used to the rotting stench of his own body,
and could barely sense it, himself. A Gust of wind brought the sounds
reverberating louder, and carried with it, a hint of smell. It too,
was the smell of rot and decay, and though faint, was distinctly
different from Richards own. In a way, it was also fresh and
invigorating. This new smell only stoked Richards hunger, and he
redoubled his efforts at finding its source. He burst through a
thicket of trees, onto a rocky beach, and found what he was searching
for. It was the Pacific Ocean. Waves crashed against the rocks,
churning the water in a frothy swirl before washing up on the sand.
Nearby a pod of seals bleated, and flopped around on the rocks near
the edge of the surf. </font>

second, before breaking into a quick trot towards them. As he
approached, they dove into the sea. Their bodies, bloated and clumsy
on land, became lithe and graceful in the water. Richard waded out
after them, but they avoided him with ease. Soon he was up to his
armpits, and the waves rocked him back and forth as they rolled
around him. He could barely touch the seabed with his toes, and he
struggled to keep purchase. He was trying to make his way back
towards the shore, when he heard the deep, rumbling bellows of a fog
horn. It was a fishing boat coming into port, heading for the dock in
the distance, which was currently obscured by the billows of fog
rolling off the sea. He could make out the silhouettes of men on the
deck, and waded towards the fishing boat, but was soon treading
water. He managed to stay afloat for a while, but as he neared the
boat, his head began to bob underwater. A flood light snapped on,
aimed at him, and he heard voices yelling from on deck, as he
struggled not to go under. A life preserver hit the water nearby, and
he lunged for it, managing to get an arm through. He was then able to
wrap his other arm around it, and hang on while they hauled him out
of the water. Several men pulled him over the railing, and Richard
flopped onto his back, surrounded by a spreading pool of cold pacific
ocean. </font>

leg he had torn off, and used the railing to pull himself up. The
sailors formed a wide semi-circle around him. At first too stunned to
react, they were still hesitant, and tried to keep their distance
while simultaneously closing in on him. Richard swayed back and
forth, then lunged at the man directly in front of him, wrapping
around his body like the spider embraces the fly.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Lazaro sat in the cab perched
high atop the dock crane he operated, eating a bologna sandwich. It
was his lunch break, but sometimes he spent them up here. He enjoyed
his job. The heights didn't bother him, he was cool under the
pressure of operating a massive, costly piece of machinery, and it
was peaceful up here by himself. That was why he spent his lunch
break up here. No annoying co-workers, no wife bitching at him, no
screaming kids, just him and the birds. As he sat with his feet up,
eating his sandwich, he watched the banks of fog drift slow across
the water. Through one of them, he could see the shape of a fishing
boat resolve. He could tell it was a fishing boat, because of the
shape. It was a Trawler, designed not for speed, but to haul nets
full of fish in the water behind it. He cracked open a can of soda,
and took a couple sips. When he had worked down on the docks, he
often had a beer with his lunch, as did many of the guys. If he had
been caught drinking while operating the crane, however, he would be
fired quicker than a speeding marlin. So now he drank soda. He took
another sip, and as the fishing boat approached, he could make out
the tiny shapes of men, running around like ants, on the deck. The
boat grew closer, and it occurred to Lazaro that they were coming in
kind of fast. It was then, that he saw some of the tiny ant-men
jumping overboard. His feet dropped to the floor as he sat up in his
seat, watching the boat grow closer still. Something was definitely
wrong, it should be slowing down by now, and on the ground, some of
the men had dropped what they were doing, and were pointing at the
approaching vessel. Then they ran, as the boat reached the end of
it's collision course.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Lazaro could hear the great
rending of wood, as the bow made contact with the dock, and plowed
through it. Beams of timber, and ragged shards of metal flew through
the air, crushing shipping containers, and tearing apart fleeing men.
As the boat slowed, waves of people spilled over the sides, some of
them plunging into the water, and some landing on the dock with
sickening thuds. Many of them, after what should have been a fatal
fall, rose again, with twisted limbs and faces. They chased down the
fleeing dock workers, and tore into their flesh with gnashing teeth.
Swarms of them would pile over the wounded, pulling their bodies
apart and devouring them like … ants. Lazaro sat watching in
horror, and reached over to snap shut the door lock. It looked like
he would be up here for a while. He wished he had a beer.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Richard tumbled over the side
of the fishing boat onto a squirming pile of undead bodies, and
rolled down onto the dock. Regaining his feet, Richard took in his
surroundings. Packs of his fellow undead chased fleeing workers down
the docks, closing on them, and pulling them to the ground. The
gurgling screams of dying men wafted on the cool ocean breeze.
Richard would approach packs of the feeding zombies, but each time
they would turn their heads up to hiss and wail at him. Reaching the
end of the dock, Richard followed the dirt trail which led back into
the woods. The fog that floated between the trees, diffused the
light, and he could not see the sun in the sky. It appeared the fog
itself was glowing a pale blue-grey. Thick patches, and wispy
tendrils drifting by entranced him. </font>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A man named Darcy crouched
behind a rock to the left of the trail, too afraid to fight, and too
afraid to flee. Darcy's father had been one of those men always on
the road, never settling in one place too long, never happy unless on
the move. He gathered no moss, and had no time to raise a child. He
was also a Johnny Cash fan, and so inspired by “A Boy Named Sue”,
he had named his son Darcy. However, when Darcy was inevitably picked
on, he did not fight back, or rise to the occasion, but sunk away
from it. He became a meek, cowering mouse of a man. As Richard passed
the rock behind which Darcy hid, Darcy started to panic. His heart
was racing like a humming bird, and he broke out in hives, his body
itching all over. He felt a tickle in his throat and tried to hold
back a cough. His knees throbbed from kneeling, and dry twigs beneath
his feet threatened to snap if he shifted his weight. Something was
bound to give him away, and he knew it. That is the fate of his kind.
He held his arm over his mouth, trying to muffle his cough, and felt
a lump of phlegm spatter against his sleeve. On the trail, he heard
Richard pause for a moment, then turn and approach his hiding place.
Now he had no choice. Bracing his feet against the rock, he leapt up
and ran into the woods. Richard issued a guttural moan and took off
in pursuit. After two minutes of running at full speed through the
forest, with branches whipping at his face, Darcy's lungs began to
burn, and he felt a stitch developing in his side. He knew he could
not continue at this pace for much longer, but still heard Richard
not far behind. So when he ran into a small clearing with a tall tree
in the center, he took his opportunity. Using the stubs of broken
branches as hand-holds, and foot-holds, he managed to climb high
enough so that he could grab the lowest intact branch, and pull
himself up into the tree. As he hauled himself up, Richard came
bursting into the clearing, and threw himself against the trunk of
the tree. Leaping and snarling, he swung his arms above him, but the
branches were too high to reach. When he realized he could not climb
the tree he circled it three times, always looking up at Darcy, his
jaw hanging open. Then he stopped and stood motionless, staring up.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Hours had passed, Richard
didn't know how many. It was now dark, but it made no difference to
him. He could stand here indefinitely, waiting for something to
happen. Then something did. A, deer burst from the foliage to his
right, bound across the clearing, and disappeared back into the
woods. Richard broke into a run, following after the animal. The
deer, however, was too quick for him, and Richard had soon lost track
of it. He moaned half-heartedly after the deer, then turned and
ambled back towards the tree in the clearing, where he knew there
would be food waiting for him. When he reached it, Darcy was climbing
down. He was at the lowest branch, about to drop to the ground.
Richard ran towards him, jumping in the air and snatching at Darcy's
dangling foot, But Darcy was too quick. Pulling his leg up, he
scrambled back into the tree. But in his haste, his foot slipped when
a patch of bark beneath it crumbled and sloughed off. He pitched
forward, a limb cracking against the bridge of his nose. Bright
silver bursts of pain as he clutched his wounded face, and then he
was tumbling down through the branches.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Richard watched as Darcy hit
the ground with a satisfying thud, and in moments Richard was on him.
Chewing on Darcy's face, and cracking open his ribcage to get at the
steaming organs. He reveled in the orgasm of flesh, and hot, salty
blood. The meal, hard-earned, tasted that much better. His initial
lust satiated, Richard sat picking at his meal, when a young woman
stumbled into the clearing. She was dead too, but freshly turned, her
body still in pretty good shape. And what a shape it was, Richard
felt long-forgotten urges stirring in the ancient recesses of his
mind. She approached the fresh corpse with caution, groaning and
gurgling. Richard stepped back, inviting her to feed. She knelt but
kept her eyes on Richard as her mouth tore a bite off of the arm.
Richard drew closer, and she jumped, but kept eating. He crouched
across from her, and they looked into each others eyes as they fed.
When the body was stripped of everything edible, they stood, and
circled the sad looking pile of bones, with eyes locked. Moaning and
whining at each other, they moved closer, until Richard stepped over
the body and grabbing her arms, pulled her body against his. He
smelled her neck, and she moaned with pleasure. He could feel her
grey nipples growing erect against his chest. It began to rain, the
water washing away the blood. They rutted there in the mud, next to
the remains of their meal, and Richard shot his diseased seed inside
of her. When he awoke the next morning, she was gone. He looked
around, and with a sighing moan wandered off in search of another
meal.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Her name was Valerie, and she
was walking through the forest looking for a place to nest. Deep in
the woods, she happened upon the entrance to a small cave, between
two great boulders. Getting down on her hands and knees, she crawled
inside, and there on a bed of dry leaves, she slumbered as the baby
grew inside her belly. By the time she emerged, her belly was
distended, and lumps writhed beneath its skin. She fell on her back
and moaned in pain, as the baby began to eat its way out. Like a
chicken emerging from the egg, it broke through, and in a spill of
blood, crawled out. Valerie sat up, and holding the grey mewling
creature in front of her, smiled with relief. She cradled it against
her chest and pressed her lips against it's forehead. Her teeth sank
into the soft, newly-formed skull, as she scooped out a bite of its
head, and sat there chewing, with a look of contentment on her face.
Ah, the miracle of life.</font></p>
